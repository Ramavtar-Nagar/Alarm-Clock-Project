# Alarm Clock Project

It is an alarm clock project.

In this project we can set alarms using the differeent input fields given for different kind of input like hours, minutes, second and AM/PM etc.

It has a list of alarms and if we add any new alarm it also get added to the list of the alarm with different alarms.

And from list of the alarms list if any of the alarm hits we just got an alert! message for the particular alarm that this particular alarm for particular time is Matched!

It also had a delete button functionality so that in case if we want to delete any of the alarm from the list than we can easily delete it just by cliclking the delete button.
